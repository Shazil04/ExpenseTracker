## Coding Guidelines

* Keep code clean, readable, and well-commented
* Use **meaningful variable and function names**
* Follow C++ best practices:

  * Use **CamelCase** for class names (`ExpenseManager`)
  * Use **snake\_case** for variables and functions (`total_amount`, `add_expense`)
  * Keep functions short and focused
  * Avoid magic numbers â€” use constants instead
  * Prefer `const` and references where applicable
  * Indent code consistently (4 spaces, no tabs)
  * Use header files (`.h`) for declarations and `.cpp` for definitions
